# [WIP] Code Coverage Tools

Code coverage tools are a great complement to our testing harness that we set up previously. They are important to allow us to know the amount of code that is covered by tests and the different kinds of coverage that we have.

In this exercise, we will focus on understanding what coverage means, how to set it up, and how to increase it by changing our tests.

## Needed Tools

1. Version Control
2. Programming Language/Platform
3. Linter
4. Test Harness

## Setup

1. Ensure that `node >= 8.6` is installed
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm test`, you should expect to see all tests passing and some code coverage

## Goals

Our goals in the following exercises are:

1. Gain an understanding of what coverage is and what specific kinds of coverage there are and what they measure.
2. Learn how to set up and configure code coverage tooling and reporting.
3. Learn how to improve code coverage by changing our tests.

## Steps

### Setup

Our steps will be the following:

1. Install `nyc` as your code coverage tool. If you're using `jest`, you will already have access to built in code coverage but for this exercise will explore `nyc` + `mocha`.
	
	`npm install nyc --save-dev`
2. Install `opn-cli` to help us open the coverage file from the command line across different OSes

	`npm install opn-cli --save-dev`
3. Change the script `"test:unit"` in `package.json` to include `nyc`. We do this by calling it before mocha like:
	
	`"./node_modules/.bin/nyc ./node_module/.bin/mocha tests"`
4. Run `npm run test:unit` and look for the coverage report being printed in your shell. You should see that we already have 100% coverage.
5. Add report generation after each test. Update `npm test` to the following:

    `"npm run test:lint && npm run test:unit && ./node_modules/.bin/nyc report --reporter=html"`
6. Add a way for us to display HTML reports of our coverage for deeper analysis by adding a new script with key `"report"` and value
	
	`"./node_modules/.bin/nyc report --reporter=html && ./node_modules/.bin/open-cli coverage/index.html"`
7. Open the HTML report with `npm run report`
8. Each time we run our tests, we can simply refresh the HTML page and get an updated view of our coverage

### Configuration

By default, `nyc` will only cover the required files in your tests. If you want to cover specific files or all files, we will need to make specific modifications to our setup.

1. Include all files, even if they're never required in our tests. We may find files that we didn't write tests for! Update your `"test:unit"` script to include the `--all` flag. The command will look like:
	
	`"./node_modules/.bin/nyc --all ./node_modules/.bin/mocha tests"`
2. Run `npm test:unit` to see that now we missed `src/date_util.js` and `src/bower_components/jquery.js` and our overall coverage level has dropped.
3. We can also put config into a JSON file named `.nycrc.json`. Try creating a file with the following JSON data:
	
	```
	{
	    "all": true
	}
	```
	
	and remove the `--all` flag in your `package.json`
4. Run `npm run test:unit` to see the same level of coverage as when we used the `--all` flag
5. We don't want to include files in `bower_components` in our code coverage count so we're going to modify our coverage config file to exlcude that entire folder:

	```
	{
	    "all": true,
	    "exclude": ["**/bower_components/**/*.js"]
	}
	```
6. We can see in our coverage that we're including test files. If we want to strictly define what to include like below:

	```
	{
	    "all": true,
	    "include": ["src/**/*.js"],
	    "exclude": ["**/bower_components/**/*.js"]
	}
	```

	You should only see the files `src/math_util.js` and `src/date_util.js` being covered.

### Explaining Coverage Terms

Our code coverage tools tells us about 4 different kinds of coverage:

1. Function Coverage
2. Line Coverage
3. Branch Coverage
4. Statement Coverage

For each, we will discuss:

1. The precise definition
2. How to improve it

#### Function Converage

Function coverage is the measurement of the percentage of defined functions which are actually called in your tests.

Example Code:

```
function a(x) {
    if (x % 2 === 0) {
        return 'a';
    } else {
        return 'a2';
    }
}

function b() {
    return 'b';
}

function c() {
    return 'c';
}
```

Example Test:

```
it('should a', () => {
    a(2);
});
```

Your function coverage when having this test case will be `33%` because you've covered `1/3` functions in your test.

Second Example Test:

```
it('should return a', () => {
    a(2);
});

it('should return a2', () => {
    a(1);
});
```

Your function coverage will still be only `33%` because you haven't covered the functions `b` or `c`. In order to improve your function coverage to `100%`, you will need to write another 2 tests to cover the missing functions.

Function coverage is important because it tells us which functions are actually called in our code. If a function really isn't being called, it may be a sign that we're missing tests or it may be a sign of dead code that is not or cannot be called and therefore can be considered for removal. The author of the code can make the correct decision after analyzing the reason behind the missing coverage.

#### Line Coverage

Line coverage is measurement of the percentage of lines that are executed in your tests. Lines are a little more tricky to count than functions which is why it's important to use a code coverage tool.

Example Code:

```
function a(x) {
    const data = {
        hello: 'world'
    };

    if (x % 2 === 0) {
        return data;
    } else {
        return 1;
    }
}
```

The function above only has 4 lines according to the coverage tool:

1. `const data = { hello: 'world' };`
2. `if (x % 2 === 0) { ... } else { ... }`
3. `return data`
4. `return 1`

Example Test:

```
it('should return 1', () => {
    a(1);
});
```

Your total line coverage will be `75%` because you missed `#3` which is `return data;`. In order to raise your coverage to `100%`, you will need to write another test where `x` is even.

Line coverage is important because it tells you which lines of code are executed. Similarly to functions, we can gain an understanding if we're missing tests or if we have dead code when we find lines that are not covered.

#### Branch Coverage

Branch coverage is the measure of the percentage of logical branches which are covered. Consider the code below:

```
function a(x) {
    if (x % 2 === 1) {
        return 'one odd';
    }

    return 'at least one even';
}
```

In this simple, example, we see that there are 2 branches our logic can take. Either `x` is odd or it's even. A little more complicated example can look like:

```
function a(x, y) {
    if (x % 2 === 1 || y % 2 === 1) {
        return 'one odd';
    }

    return 'both even';
}
```

It looks like we still have 2 branches but this code will actually create 4 branches.

There are 4 cases with this logic:

1. x is odd AND y is odd
2. x is odd AND y is even
3. x is even AND y is odd
4. x is even AND y is even

Branch coverage is important because it represents that we have enough test cases to sufficiently exercise all of the logical branches that can happen from our logic. If we reach 100% branch coverage, then we can safely refactor the internal logic using our test suite (assuming it's a pure function without side effects). This is *NOT* true of line or function coverage.

### Enforcing Minimum Coverage

We may want to enforce minimum coverage in order to ensure that when that coverage level is not met, our tests and builds will fail. If we do this, we will guarantee that we will not ship code that doesn't meet our minimum level of expectations.

This is helpful to maintain a baseline of quality in the codebase but it won't prevent bugs by itself. We need to ensure that along with coverage, we are **writing good tests** that match the expectations of our customers.

In our `.nycrc.json` config file, we can specify the minimum percentage of each different type of coverage we'd like. For example:

```
{
    "branches": 80,
    "lines": 80,
    "functions": 80,
    "statements": 80
}
```

The above will ensure that we meet at least `80%` coverage on all the different kinds.

### Writing Tests to Increase Coverage

In the following exercise, please write tests to get `src/date_util.js` to 100% coverage across all 4 types.

Put your test file in `tests/date_util.test.js`

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've finished setting up code coverage tooling and learned how to improve it through writing tests.
